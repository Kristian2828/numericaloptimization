Title: 

1. Linear Programming (Simplex Method algorithm).

2. Constraint and Assumptions need to be established accordingly. 
a. Objective Functions:
1. The total travel distance of all vehicles to customers.

b. Assumptions:
1. The supply of products in the store warehouse is greater than the quantity sold, and there is no
out-of-stock phenomenon.
2. The distribution path is a one-way distribution between stores and customers, involving only
product distribution and excluding the task of recovery returns.
3. All distribution vehicles are of uniform specifications.
4. The speed of the delivery vehicle does not change during the delivery route, and there is no
traffic congestion on the delivery road.

c. Constraints:
1. 

d. Dataset
2. We limit to 10-30 observations.

3. Matlab/Octave/Python might be used.
