The efficiency and effectiveness of these activities directly impact a company's ability to generate profits. To ensure profitability, companies need to carefully manage their resources, including raw materials, machinery, and labor, to achieve the desired output levels with minimal costs.</p>\n",

        "<p>The simplex method is a widely used mathematical optimization technique that provides a systematic approach to solving linear programming problems. It aims to identify the optimal solution among a set of feasible solutions, considering both profit maximization and resource utilization. The simplex method does this by iteratively evaluating extreme points, or vertices, of the feasible region. By doing so, it efficiently determines the best allocation of resources, leading to an optimal production plan.</p>\n",

        "In conclusion, the linear programming model developed for optimizing the production process of snack products has provided valuable insights and solutions. By formulating an objective function to maximize the total profit and imposing various constraints, we were able to determine the optimal production quantities for Cheese Puffs, Potato Chips, and Pretzels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the results obtained from the optimization process, the optimal production quantities are as follows: 962 units of Cheese Puffs, 350 units of Potato Chips, and 250 units of Pretzels. These quantities were determined by considering the available resources, such as raw materials, machine hours, and labour hours, as well as the selling prices of the snack products.\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximum profit achieved by the optimal solution is RM8762.50, representing the highest potential earnings from the production process. This optimal solution demonstrates the effective allocation of resources and production quantities to maximize profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the results obtained from the linear programming model, it is worth noting a limitation in the optimization of the production quantities for Potato Chips and Pretzels. The model suggests producing 350 units of Potato Chips and 250 units of Pretzels, which are the lower bounds set for these products. The specified constraints, such as the availability of resources and the production capacity, may restrict the optimal production quantities for Potato Chips and Pretzels. To address this limitation, further analysis and adjustments to the model may be necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the application of linear programming techniques in optimizing the production process has proven to be a valuable tool for decision-making and maximizing profitability."
